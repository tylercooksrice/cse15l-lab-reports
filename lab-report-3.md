1. grep -c
   - source from https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Grep
```
$ grep -c "that" chapter-1.txt
172
```
This command is showing the number of times "that" apppears in this text file and can be useful because the command would show 
the amount of times a word would appear in a specfic file.

```
$ grep -c "the" *.txt
chapter-1.txt:313
chapter-10.txt:336
chapter-11.txt:533
chapter-12.txt:804
chapter-13.1.txt:643

chapter-6.txt:1046
chapter-7.txt:861
chapter-8.txt:622
chapter-9.txt:1195
preface.txt:68
```
This command is showing the number of times "the" appears in all the text files in the 911report directory in the technical directory.
In addition, this command is useful because the command shows the recurrences of a specific word in all the text files within a directory.

2. grep -b

This command shows the lines within a file that has the word "Americans" and lists the line number of the word found, which is useful as 
the command would help the user locate the line within the file to find the location of the line that contains the word given.
```
$ grep -b chapter-1.txt *
grep: 911report: Is a directory
grep: biomed: Is a directory
grep: government: Is a directory
grep: plos: Is a directory
```
This command shows which file within a directory is a directory and is useful because sometimes the user would not be able to see what other
directories exist within a directory.

911report/chapter-1.txt:    Reagan National controllers then vectored an unarmed National Guard C- 130H cargo aircraft, which had just taken off en route to Minnesota, to identify and follow the suspicious aircraft. The C-130H pilot spotted it, identified it as a Boeing 757, attempted to follow its path, and at 9:38, seconds after impact, reported to the control tower:"looks like that aircraft crashed into the Pentagon sir."

911report/chapter-1.txt:    The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when, at 9:05, Andrew Card whispered to him: "A second plane hit the second tower. America is under attack." The President told us his instinct was to project calm, not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis. The press was standing behind the children; he saw their phones and pagers start to ring. The President felt 
he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening.
911report/chapter-1.txt:    At 9:33, the tower supervisor at Reagan National Airport picked up a hotline to the Secret Service and told the Service's operations center that "an aircraft [is] coming at you and not talking with us." This was the first specific report to the Secret Service of a direct threat to the White House. No move was made to evacuate the Vice President at this time. As the officer who took the call explained, "[I was] about to push the alert button when the tower advised that the aircraft was turning south and approaching Reagan National Airport."
