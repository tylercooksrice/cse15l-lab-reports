### Lab Report 1

1. Using the command "cd" in the terminal with no arguments.

The working directory is /home.
The output remained the same and did not change the working directory. This occurred possibly because "cd"
is used to switch the current working directory to the given path, provided as an augment. Since 
no augment was provided, the current working directory was not changed, therefore the output 
remained the same.

2. Using the command "cd" in the terminal with a path to a directory as an argument.
